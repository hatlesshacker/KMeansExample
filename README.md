KMeansExample doesn't need to be installed, just run main.py with no parameters.

```sh
$ python3 main.py
```

### Using

```sh
$ python3 main.py
 ** 
 Welcome to KMeansExample.
 **

Please enter the csv file containing the student records:
```

enter the name of the CSV file containing the data. Few CSV files have already been provided with this repository.

```sh
$ python3 main.py 
 ** 
 Welcome to KMeansExample.
 **

Please enter the csv file containing the student records: data/test.csv
Working on student records at  data/test.csv  ..



  * (1) for previewing the records
  * (2) for proceeding with training
  * (3) for Exiting the predictor
Enter action:
